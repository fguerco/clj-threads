# clj-threads - Clojure threads in Common Lisp

This is my attempt to reproduce Clojure's arrow macros (`->`, `-->`
and `as->`) in Common Lisp.

## Why?

It is way for me to learn and have fun writing CL code

## Loading

```lisp
(asdf:load-system "clj-threads")
```

## Running tests

```lisp
(asdf:test-system "clj-threads")
```
